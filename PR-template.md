# Debug KV Namespace Issues in RPC Workers

## Problem
The RPC workers (baklava, alfajores, mainnet) are having issues connecting to the HEALTH_KV namespace, resulting in the error message "HEALTH_KV not available, using all backends". This prevents the passive health checks from working properly.

## Changes Made
1. Added detailed debug logging to the baklava worker to diagnose the KV namespace connection issues
2. Enhanced error handling and logging in the getHealthyBackends function
3. Improved the markBackendUnhealthy function with more detailed logging
4. Created a debug utility to inspect the environment object and KV namespace bindings

## Testing
After deploying these changes, we'll be able to see detailed logs in the Cloudflare dashboard that will help us diagnose why the RPC workers can't access the HEALTH_KV namespace while the health-check-worker can.

## Next Steps
1. Review the logs in the Cloudflare dashboard after deployment
2. Based on the logs, make further changes to fix the KV namespace connection issues
3. Once the issue is resolved, remove the debug logging
